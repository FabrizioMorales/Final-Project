                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-300">1. Encryption</h3>
                    <p>
                        Encryption is a fundamental aspect of data protection. It involves converting data into a secure format that can only be accessed by authorised users with the correct decryption key. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential and protected from unauthorised access, both in transit and at rest.

                    <p>
                        Regular data backups are crucial for protecting against data loss. Backup solutions involve creating copies of data at scheduled intervals and storing them in secure locations. These backups can be used to restore data in case of accidental deletion, hardware failure, or cyberattacks.
